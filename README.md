## Big Questions for the game
- How would playtesting be different if the person has played our game before?
Should we try to focus on new features or changed ones or let them experience
the whole playtest as regularly done?
- There’s not really a specific main mechanic in our game at the moment that
makes it stand out among competitors. While our aesthetic and premise are a
great selling point, should we be focusing on creating or improving upon specific
design aspects of the game or not try to risk centering the game too much
around a possibly janky signature mechanic that could make our game worse?
- What's a good way to test our game’s art and audio elements to see if they fit into
the game well, like playtesting specifically for them?
